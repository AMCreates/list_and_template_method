# The Creation of NOX

According to their beliefs, the Azuli, the Animus, and the Wellow were created by four powerful beings called the Void Beings. These beings of unknown origin came together to create a world. They molded a world with a variety of climates and terrain and life. The darkness of this world would be disturbed by a beautiful glow from the planet and the life on it. A range of colorful lights would pulse as if the orb were alive itself. These beings created the three peoples and gave them special abilities. 

### The Azuli: Being of the Water and Seas
- Ability to travel through water
- Water manipulation
- Incredible swimmers; can hold breath for a long time

### The Wellow: Being of the Void and the Darkness
- A monstrous side that comes out at night
- Incredible sense of smell
- Enhanced speed

### The Animus: Beings of the Stars and Sky
The Animus are a bit different from the other two groups. Two beings, twins, created them and had some creative differences when doing so. So, they created many variaitions of the Animus, some with unique abilities.

All Animus:
- Wings to fly

Bats Animus:
- Echolocation
- Great hearing
- Fangs

Bird Animus:
- Talons
- Very strong wings; better suited for the cold
- Incredible vision

Moth Animus:
- Stealth 
- Camouflage (they can blend into any environment and erase their presence)
- ????????

The planet is their gift to share and nurture.

Then, the beings disappeared. Some still believe they are watching over them, but others believe that the beings are gone forever.
