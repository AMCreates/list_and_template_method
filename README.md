# list_and_template_method
This is the world-building piece that I created using the list and template method.

- This is still pretty bare-bones.
- I am very sorry for the names, they are ALL temporary ;n; Please leave suggestions in the discussion if you have any! 
- This document will focus on planet NOX. I have plans for life beyond this planet, but that is not the focus here right now.
- Humans may exist in this universe in the future, but not at the moment.
- This is a fantasy world, so the laws of physics will be broken at times and there will be things that are not explainable or possible in terms of what we know as science. I am aiming for consistency in the rules and science/magic I create. 
- I am not focusing on language right now because that will require way more time than you or I have for this assignment.
