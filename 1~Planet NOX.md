# Planet NOX General

This planet is very dark and would look like it is always night-time (based on what we define as night). The sky would be clear, allowing the stars and even galaxies to be clearly visible from the surface of the planet. This planet orbits a very rare type of star called a Void Star. This type of star emits a unique kind of energy called Obsallum, which is hot but not very bright. (The “light” that it does produce is not on our light spectrum). The night is called “_______” and the day is called “________”. Day looks like our night with the void star in the sky and a little bit of moonlight-like illumination from it. Their version of night is a dark sky with stars, but no other planetary bodies visible. Life on this planet revolves around this day/night cycle similar to how we do.
