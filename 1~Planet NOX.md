# Planet NOX General

This planet is very dark and would look like it is always night-time (based on what we define as night). The sky would be clear, allowing the stars and even galaxies to be visible from the surface of the planet. This planet orbits a very rare type of star called a Void Star. This type of star emits a unique kind of energy called Obsallum, which is hot but not very bright. (The “light” that it does produce is not on our light spectrum). The night is called “_______” and the day is called “________”. The day looks like our night with the void star in the sky and a little bit of moonlight-like illumination from it. Their version of night is a dark sky with stars, but no other planetary bodies visible. Their night is very very dark and the only natural light source visible during this time comes from the planet itself in plants, creatures, and other natural elements. Life on this planet revolves around this day/night cycle similar to how we do.


# Climate and Some Geography Notes
The regions of this planet experience many different climates ranging from tropical to polar, and seasons with the planet’s rotation and orbit around its star. The planet also experiences a large amount of underwater volcanic activity. Most of the planet is covered in salt water (or not?) and experiences a tropical climate. Tropical zones are very hot and humid most of the time. Tropical storms are common and rain in these areas occurs at least once every 28 hours (day/night cycle; may change later). 

The northernmost region, ___________, has a continental climate. The summers there are warm to cool in temperature and the winters can be very harsh with snow, ice, and temperatures dropping well into the negatives.

The region of _____ experiences a temperate climate. The summers there are warm and humid and the winters are rather mild. 

The region of _____ experiences a rather balanced climate. The summers there are warm and very windy. The winters can get pretty cold, but nowhere near as bad as the __________ region. 


# Major Locations

## Skyline City
Skyline City is the largest city on NOX and is located _________. This dramatically verticle and layered city is the center of business, entertainment, and crime.
- gangs
- people going missing
- dancers
- appearance
- culture
- government
- drugs
- fighting rings
- economy

Most of the Animus population lives there, but the Azuli can commmonly be seen visiting or conducting business there as well. The city is very windy, which makes it a perfect area for the Animus.

## The Winding Forest
The Winding Forest is heavily inspired by the Aokigahara Forest in Japan (a temperate broadleaf and mixed forest). This forest is massive, covering much of ________. It experiences cold winters and cool to warm summers. 

The land is extremely dangerous for those who are on foot due to the expansive cave systems that seem to open up everywhere. The earth is uneven, making it hard to see where you are stepping at times, especially with the large tree roots creating a jungle gym all on their own. Ancient trees cover the sky in most parts of the forest with a thick canopy, preventing flying individuals from easily moving around either. This forest is said to be sacred and home to the Wellow. Other intelligent life knows to not enter the forest unless they have a death wish. If one were to enter the forest, even at the beginning of the day cycle, they still would not get very far before the Void Star leaves the sky once again. A sky without the Void Star in the Winding Forest is certain death. We will talk about that more later. This forest is the darkest part of the planet as the trees that make it up do not glow like most trees do on NOX.


## The Azuli Coast
The Azuli Coast is the main hub for the Azuli and the second biggest city on NOX. It is a tropical paradise with black sand beaches, glowing foliage, tall seaside cliffs, and a bustling long city that overlooks the Azure Sea. The city has a lower section closer to the sea and a section built into the rock of the cliffside. Water makes this city run. Canals weave around the buildings. Many buildings near the water even have water entrances to them. 

Most of the Azuli live there, but there are smaller communities that settle in more rural areas. Some Animus live there as well, especially those who have some sort of talent for swimming. Crime is much lower in this city.

- exports
- culture
- economy
- government


## Oceans and Seas
The planet is mostly covered by water.
The Azure Sea (near the Azuli Coast/Capital) warm; lots of bioluminescence 
The dark sea (cold water near forest)
The tides (dangerous area full of currents)
