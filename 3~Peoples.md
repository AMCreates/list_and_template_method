# Quick Note
Species cannot cross-breed. It is against their nature and biologically impossible. While humans do not exist, I will be basing the appearances of the species on NOX off them, at least for now.

# Animus
- The Animus is a species living on NOX that is made up of a few different subspecies (I may add more later). They all have wings and can fly, but each subspecies has different abilities, strengths, weaknesses, and experiences in society. Skin color amongst the Animus varies, but will always be a neutral color (like humans). The Animus are naturally omnivorous.

## Subspecies

## 1. Bat Animus:
- Bat Animus have a pair of bat wings on their backs. These wings vary in color from black to tan. They may not be as strong as the Aves Animus, but they are faster with short-distance flying and more agile. 

### Abilities:
- Bat Animus can use echolocation to communicate with each other and locate objects when the Void Star is not in the sky or there are unusually low-light conditions. They also, in general, have great hearing and sharp fangs that they can use to fight with if needed. 

## 2. Aves Animus: 
- Aves Animus have a pair of feathered wings on their backs. These wings vary greatly with different colors, patters, sizes, and feather shapes. 

### Abilities:
- The Aves Animus have incredibly strong wings, allowing them to fly in unstable flying conditions and strong winds more easily. They are best at flying long distances but can reach great speeds over time while gliding or diving. They are also better in the extreme cold than other Animus. Aves Animus also have very impressive vision, allowing them to see small objects from very far away. This helps when they are flying high in the sky to see things going on down below. 


## 3. Moth Animus:
- The Moth Animus have a distinct pair of moth-like wings on their backs. These wings vary in color, shape, pattern, and size. Moth Animus are typically not as physically strong as the other Animus subspecies due to not being able to gain muscle as easily, but it is not impossible. They are not as good at flying either, but they are silent fliers, allowing them to get around quietly. Moth Animus are known for their beauty, which is why most exotic performers are moths. 

### Abilities:
- The Moth Animus have a natural talent for stealth. They can camouflage themselves into any environment and erase their presence. With practice, they can become undetectable in every way possible. While it has never been officially reported, there are rumors that some Moth Animus can go through "The Change." (the names >n< I KNOW IM SORRY AHH) This event is when, for some reason, the Moth Animus gains a special ability. Some say that they gain the power to control someone's mind, or that they can even morph into other people. 

## Animus Society
- The Animus mostly live in Skyline City. They prefer the verticality of the city that was built mostly by their kind. While all Animus are given equal opportunity in society, their biological differences can impact their jobs and have led to the development of stereotypes. The Animus are not as close as other species are with their own kind. They typically live faster-paced lives in the city and prefer to trust in themselves over others.

Eyes:
Theyd all have great night vision; large pupils at night or in darkness
Pupils could become more sharp around a lot of bioluminesence 
Azuli have white, silver, and blue eyes
Anima would have a larger variety of eye colors
Wellows would have yellow, green, and brown eye colors.
