# Wellow
One is human-like and the other is animalistic. A dark entity. 
They live in the mountainous forests and caves.
They do not like the noise of the city and prefer to be closer to nature.
That side of them is stronger and faster, but can’t talk. 
No one is sure which version is “original,” they are born as both. 
A people said to be blessed by the god of the moon.
Some people wanted to research them and try to use them to make super soldiers. Created a new type of person, but they can’t control the dark side. 
Prefer quiet dark places.
Pretty secretive people; people do not really see them
Very spiritual people
