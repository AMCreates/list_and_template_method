# Note
- I am afraid that this document is getting too long for you all so this page is brief and only lists more important things.

# Plants
- Bioluminescence can be seen everywhere, including on plants, animals, and even in some natural minerals.
- Plants do not need the Sun and feed off of the energy from the Void Star.
- The plants in the Wellow forest do not glow, which is why the forest is so dark.

# Animals and Creatures
- Animals use their glowing patterns to help them blend in with the environment. Most animals have good night vision.
- Giant sea creatures for the deep sea.
- Sea wyverns (not sure if that is the right term for them, but I have a vision lol) that will be ridden by the Azuli eventually.
