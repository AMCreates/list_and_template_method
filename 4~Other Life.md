# Note
- I am afraid that this document is getting too long for you all so this page is brief and only lists more important things.

# Plants
- Bioluminesence is everywhere.
- Plants do not need the Sun and feed off of the energy from the Void Star.

# Animals and Creatures
- Giant sea creatures for the deep sea.
- Sea wyverns (not sure if that is the right term for them, but I have a vision lol) that will be ridden by the Azuli eventually.
